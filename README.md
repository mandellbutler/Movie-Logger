# Description

Movie Logger is an app that allows the user to log their movie viewing experience. Currently it allows the user to create an account and rate films out of 5 stars. Once rated, the movie is saved in the user dashboard.

Upcoming features include: 

1. Movie viewing achievements to "game-ify" the app.
2. Allow users to record the status of the movie as "watched", "watching", or "dropped".
3. Recommendation system that collects user preferences and suggests movies between users that have similar tastes.
4. Monetize the site by accepting sponsorships and using affiliate links to purchase movie merchandise including home media.
